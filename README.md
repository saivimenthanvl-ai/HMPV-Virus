# 🦠 Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV): AI-Powered Diagnosis & Immune Evasion

- 🚨 **Overview:**  
Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. It poses a serious threat to children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.

- 🧑‍⚕️ **Clinical Importance:**
The clinical severity escalates with comorbidities such as advanced age, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular issues, and weakened immunity. Early detection and risk stratification are essential for effective management.

- 🌍 **Epidemiology:**  
  HMPV is prevalent worldwide, with fluctuations in incidence and seasonal outbreaks. Regional studies show it can account for up to 10% of hospital admissions for acute respiratory illness.

- 🔬 **Immune Evasion:**  
  HMPV uses viral proteins (G, SH, M2.2, F) to evade host immune responses by inhibiting interferon pathways and sabotaging innate immunity. This enables viral persistence and increases disease burden.

- 🤖 **AI-Enabled Diagnostics:**  
  Novel deep learning pipelines utilize MobileNetV2, ResNet-50, UNet, and LSTM architectures. They achieve high accuracy by enhancing lung image segmentation, temporal progression modeling, and virus classification.

- 🗂️ **Data Methodology:**  
  The imaging dataset is split into train, test, and validation sets. Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation, ensuring robust and unbiased model evaluation.

- 🏥 **Clinical Implementation:**  
  AI-powered diagnostics support real-time clinical decision-making. Models show >95% accuracy and facilitate the early identification of HMPV and related comorbidities such as pneumonia and ARDS.

- 🧠 **Multimodal Integration:**  
  Future pipelines aim to integrate clinical notes, lab results, and imaging data using attention mechanisms. This will enable holistic patient assessment and personalized management strategies.

- 🚀 **Deployment & Future Directions:**  
  Efficient deployment at the point of care is becoming possible with edge devices and federated learning. Continued validation and global multi-center studies are critical for improving outcomes.

## 🦠 Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) Structure and Immune Evasion

- **Central Structure:**  
  The illustration shows the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) particle. The green spiral represents its RNA genome, which is surrounded by various viral and internal proteins embedded in the viral envelope.

- **Viral Proteins (Surface):**  
  - *G protein (purple):* Inhibits interferon (IFN) pathway and blocks innate immune responses, helping the virus evade detection.
  - *SH protein (blue):* Suppresses IFN signaling and inhibits the host's Type I IFN production.

- **Internal Proteins:**  
  - *F protein:* Facilitates fusion of the virus with host cell membranes and downregulates Type I IFN, aiding in viral entry and immune escape. Also contains RGD motif for interaction with host integrins.
  - *P, M, M2.2, L proteins:* Essential for replication and RNA synthesis during the viral cycle.  
  - Proteins M2.1 and palP7 are only expressed during active replication.

- **Genome Layout:**  
  - The RNA genome is organized: `3′ N—P—M—F—M2—SH—G—L 5′`, encoding all the above proteins for replication and immune evasion.

- **Roles in Immune Evasion:**  
  - *G protein:* Inhibits IFN and innate immunity pathways.
  - *M2.2 protein:* Disrupts MAVS signaling, recruits neutrophils.
  - *SH protein:* Halts antiviral responses.
  - *F protein:* Interacts with host cell integrins, facilitating immune modulation and infection.
