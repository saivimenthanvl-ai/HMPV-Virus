# 🦠 Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV): AI-Powered Diagnosis & Immune Evasion

- 🚨 **Overview:**  
Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a leading cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. It poses a serious threat to children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.

- 🧑‍⚕️ **Clinical Importance:**
The clinical severity escalates with comorbidities such as advanced age, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular issues, and weakened immunity. Early detection and risk stratification are essential for effective management.

- 🌍 **Epidemiology:**  
  HMPV is prevalent worldwide, with fluctuations in incidence and seasonal outbreaks. Regional studies show it can account for up to 10% of hospital admissions for acute respiratory illness.

- 🔬 **Immune Evasion:**  
  HMPV uses viral proteins (G, SH, M2.2, F) to evade host immune responses by inhibiting interferon pathways and sabotaging innate immunity. This enables viral persistence and increases disease burden.

- 🤖 **AI-Enabled Diagnostics:**  
  Novel deep learning pipelines utilize MobileNetV2, ResNet-50, UNet, and LSTM architectures. They achieve high accuracy by enhancing lung image segmentation, temporal progression modeling, and virus classification.

- 🗂️ **Data Methodology:**  
  The imaging dataset is split into train, test, and validation sets. Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation, ensuring robust and unbiased model evaluation.

- 🏥 **Clinical Implementation:**  
  AI-powered diagnostics support real-time clinical decision-making. Models show >95% accuracy and facilitate the early identification of HMPV and related comorbidities such as pneumonia and ARDS.

- 🧠 **Multimodal Integration:**  
  Future pipelines aim to integrate clinical notes, lab results, and imaging data using attention mechanisms. This will enable holistic patient assessment and personalized management strategies.

- 🚀 **Deployment & Future Directions:**  
  Efficient deployment at the point of care is becoming possible with edge devices and federated learning. Continued validation and global multi-center studies are critical for improving outcomes.
